# Algorithms-Fib-Matrix
Homework Project featuring the time difference between naive recursion algorithm and matrix algorithm for the Fibonacci sequence

- Certain files were created by the instructor: Makefile, Matrix.h, proj1.cc, some details of Matrix.cc.
- Important functional implementation details were coded by me.  
- Homework assignment aimed to show the time save of the matrix implementation as well as help us understand it.
